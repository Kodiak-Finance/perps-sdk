      Orderly Network is a combination of an orderbook-based trading
      infrastructure and a robust liquidity layer offering spot and perpetual
      futures orderbooks. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesnâ€™t have a
      front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing
      essential services to projects built on top of it. Our DEX white-label
      solution is carefully crafted to save builders time and capital while
      granting access to our bootstrapped liquidity. Picture having the best
      features of CEXs while keeping settlements on-chain and maintaining full
      self-custody. With Orderly, anyone can create a trading application thanks
      to our seamless plug-and-play experience leveraging our liquidity and
      composability. Looking ahead, our grand vision is to create an omnichain
      protocol, connecting traders from both EVM and non-EVM chains within the
      same orderbook.

# Orderbook

`@orderly.network/hooks` provides [`useOrderbookStream`](/) to return formatted data of the orderbook, making it easy for the orderbook to be displayed on the UI. When the `symbol` parameter changes, the hook will automatically subscribe for the data of the new symbol, thus no additional handling is required.

```typescript
const [data, { onDepthChange, isLoading, onItemClick, depth, allDepths }] =
  useOrderbookStream(symbol, undefined, {
    level: 7,
  });
```

`useOrderbookStream` returns an array, where the first element is the formatted orderbook data and the second element is an `object` conatining some data regarding the orderbook status.

## Data structure

`[0]` The orderbook data format is as follows:

```typescript
// Taking a data snapshot of PERP_ETH_USDC as an example
{
  asks: [
    [],
    ...
  ],
  bids: [
    [],
    ...
  ],
  markPrice: 999,
  middlePrice: 999,
}
```

- The data in each of the asks/bids is (in order):
  - Price
  - Quantity
  - Aggregated quantity, which is the sum of the current row plus all preceding rows
- asks - List of ask order levels, sorted in ascending order
- bids - List of bid order levels, sorted in descending order

<Callout type="info">
  **Notice:** The default length of the orderbook is 10. This can be modified through the `level` parameter.
</Callout>

## Depth

### allDepths

`allDepths` is an array containing all the different price tick granularities that the current symbol supports.

### onDepthChange

`onDepthChange` is a function that is used when a user changes the price tick granularity display of the orderbook. The hook will aggregate the orderbook levels according to this parameter when providing the orderbook data.

<LivePreview />

</div>
  
  <LiveError />
</LiveProvider>

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Withdraw />
  );
};

                title:'Withdraw',
                content:<Withdraw/>
            });
        }}>Open withdraw dialog</Button>
</Page>
    )
}`} scope={{Withdraw,Page,Button,dialog:modal.dialog}}>
<div className="flex justify-center py-10 mt-5 rounded shadow-lg bg-base-700 color-item">

<LivePreview />

</div>

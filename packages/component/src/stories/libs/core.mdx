# Core

@orderly.network/core

## Introduction

The @orderly.network/core library is the foundation of the entire Orderly JS SDK, so when you use `@orderly.network/react` or @orderly.network/hooks, you must also install it. Of course, you can also use it independently to create an Orderly account, sign information, manage assets, and more. It includes the following features:

- 新建 Account
- 创建 OrderlyKey
- 签名
- 资产相关的操作
  - deposit
  - withdraw
  - 查询个人钱包余额

## Installation

```bash
npm install @orderly.network/core
```
